The major goal of any programming language is to bridge the gap between the programmer's brain and the
computer. Most of the popular languages you've probably heard of, like C, C++, C#, and Java, are considered
high-level languages, which means that they're closer to human language than machine language. And they
are. But Python, with its clear and simple rules, is even closer to English than any of these. Creating Python
programming is so straightforward that it's been called "programming at the speed of thought."
Python's ease of use translates into productivity for professional programmers. Python programs are shorter
and take less time to create than programs in many other popular languages. In fact, Python programs are
typically 3 to 5 times shorter than equivalent Java programs, and often 5 to 10 times shorter than equivalent
C++ programs. There's even some evidence to suggest that a single Python programmer can finish in two
months what takes two C++ programmers more than a year to complete.
