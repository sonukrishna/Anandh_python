if you don’t know grammar, you can’t write English!.
Ya gotta know all the rules 
and structures inside out
before you start to break them—and make truly
great music.
Using a language may be compared to riding a horse:.
much of one’s success. 
depends upon an understanding
of what it can and will do.
